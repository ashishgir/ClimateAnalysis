# ClimateAnalysis
In this project we have analysed Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature dataset using MapReduce , Hive, Spark and BigQuery in Google Cloud Platform(GCP).

# Abstract
Climate science as a data-intensive subject has overwhelmingly affected by the era of big data
and relevant technological revolutions. The big successes of big data analytics in diverse areas over the past decade have also prompted the expectation of big data and its efficacy on the big problem—climate change. Earth is a complex dynamical system thereafter, big data analytics encountered more challenges in climate science than other subjects regardless of the extensive resources of big climate data. As an emerging topic, climate change has been at the forefront of the big climate data analytics implementations and exhaustive research have been carried out covering a variety of topics. It is also expected to serve as a one-stop reference directory for researchers and stakeholders with an overview of this trending subject at a glance, which can be useful in guiding future research and improvements in the exploitation of big climate data. Big Data Mining for Climate Change delivers a rich understanding of climate-related big data techniques and highlights how to navigate huge amount of climate data and resources available using big data applications. It guides future directions and will boom big-data-driven researches on modeling, diagnosing and predicting climate change and mitigating related impacts. As part of the Administration's Climate Data Initiative, climate.data.gov provides access to Federal resources to help America’s communities, businesses, and citizens plan and prepare for climate change. For climate scientists, the utility of big data is not new. ML has seen use for some time in modeling the global climate system. But big data techniques are still emerging in the socioeconomic aspects of climate research, and by extension, I make the case below for how big data could have a positive impact on quantitative climate-conflict research.

# Dataset
Some say climate change is the biggest threat of our age while others say it’s a myth based on dodgy science. We are turning some of the data over to you so you can form your own view. In this dataset, we have include several files:

Global Land and Ocean-and-Land Temperatures (GlobalTemperatures.csv):

Date: starts in 1750 for average land temperature and 1850 for max and min land temperatures and global ocean and land temperatures
LandAverageTemperature: global average land temperature in celsius
LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the average
LandMaxTemperature: global average maximum land temperature in celsius
LandMaxTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the maximum land temperature
LandMinTemperature: global average minimum land temperature in celsius
LandMinTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the minimum land temperature
LandAndOceanAverageTemperature: global average land and ocean temperature in celsius
LandAndOceanAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the global average land and ocean temperature
Other files include:

Global Average Land Temperature by Country (GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv)
Global Average Land Temperature by State (GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv)
Global Land Temperatures By Major City (GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity.csv)
Global Land Temperatures By City (GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv)
The raw data comes from the Berkeley Earth data page.

# Problem Statement
We mainly focused on these problem statements along with displaying these on real time web application.

Date: starts in 1750 for average land temperature and 1850 for max and min land temperatures and global ocean and land temperatures
LandAverageTemperature: global average land temperature in celsius
LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the average
LandMaxTemperature: global average maximum land temperature in celsius
LandMaxTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the maximum land temperature
LandMinTemperature: global average minimum land temperature in celsius
LandMinTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the minimum land temperature
LandAndOceanAverageTemperature: global average land and ocean temperature in celsius
LandAndOceanAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the global average land and ocean temperature
